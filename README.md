# movie-recommendation-engine

## Credits

This project is based on the tutorial by Code Heroku, where the instructor explains the fundamental ML concept behind recommendation systems and focuses on building a movie recommendation engine as an example.

I realised that SublimeText isn't free after a certain point and ended up using PyCharm. I have added some comments in the code files stating my takeaways and the need for every step. The only change I made was parsing the value returned from the giveIndexFromTitle function to solve an error that I was getting, saying that the input to the cosine similarity function has to be an integer. It was fun experimenting with different Scikit-learn functions while understanding the math behind it. This video has truly gotten me hooked to exploring more of Machine Learning.
